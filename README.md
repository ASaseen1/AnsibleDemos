# AnsibleDemos
This repository has some of the playbooks which can help you get familiarized with Ansible! Do feel free to add your own experiments with playbooks if they can help others solve issues and learn! Happy coding :D

Do raise PRs if you feel the code can be improved (I'm pretty sure it can :P). It'll be fun to see where it goes! :D

I Will be adding more generic codes for installations / setups. Please feel free to suggest some infrastructure setups you would like to see. Hoping to get a great learning curve out of this experience! :D :D

The basic tomcat installation playbook was written in a system with the below mentioned specs:

  OS: RHEL 7.5
  Ansible Version: 2.5
  Tomcat 8
  Java 1.8+

  Add the necessary values in the hosts file as per your need.
  The username and password for the Tomcat manager can be changed in the variables section of the tomcat role. Default tomcat/tomcat.

Keep an eye out for updates! :)
